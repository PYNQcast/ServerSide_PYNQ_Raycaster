# ec2/server/server.py
#
# Python SEDA game server : entry point.
#
# 4-stage pipeline: T1 → T2 → T3 (asyncio), T4 (thread)
#
#   T1 UDPReceiver   asyncio  → packet_queue (asyncio.Queue)   → T2 GameTick
#   T2 GameTick      asyncio  → broadcast_queue (asyncio.Queue) → T3 Broadcaster
#   T2 GameTick      asyncio  → write_queue (SimpleQueue)       → T4 RedisWriter
#   T4 RedisWriter   thread   → Redis (blocking calls, isolated from event loop)
#
# T1/T2/T3 run as asyncio coroutines in a single event loop — cooperative,
# no locks needed on shared state (self.players in T2).
# T4 runs as a dedicated OS thread — Redis latency never stalls T2/T3.
# The SimpleQueue between T2 and T4 is the thread-safe SEDA stage boundary.
#
# T1 and T3 share the same UDP socket (port 9000) so that broadcast replies
# come from EC2:9000 — matching the NAT mapping the node's sendto created.
#
# Run on EC2:
#   python3 ec2/server/server.py
# Requires: pip install redis

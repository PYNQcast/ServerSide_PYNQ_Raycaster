# ec2/server/t4_redis_writer.py
#
# T4 : RedisWriter  —  runs as a dedicated OS thread, NOT an asyncio coroutine.
#
# Why a thread here?
#   Redis HSET/LPUSH calls take 1-5ms over the network. Inside the asyncio event
#   loop that latency would briefly stall T2 and T3 on every await. Moving T4 to
#   its own thread means Redis latency is fully isolated — the event loop never
#   waits for it. This is the one stage where threading beats asyncio.
#
# Thread-safety:
#   asyncio.Queue is NOT thread-safe for get()/put() from a thread directly.
#   Instead we use queue.SimpleQueue (stdlib, fully thread-safe) as the hand-off.
#   T2 puts items onto write_queue (a SimpleQueue) from the event loop;
#   T4's thread blocks on write_queue.get() — zero CPU while idle.
#
# Pipeline batching:
#   Every tick T2 pushes one HSET per player. Rather than executing each as a
#   separate round-trip, _drain() collects everything currently on the queue,
#   batches all HSETs into a single redis.pipeline().execute() call, then handles
#   any LPUSHes individually (rare events — no benefit batching them).
#   On localhost this saves ~0.05ms per extra player; on ElastiCache (~0.5ms RTT)
#   it becomes meaningful immediately.
#
# Queue input (from T2):
#   {"op": "hset",  "key": str, "mapping": dict}  : player position, every tick
#   {"op": "lpush", "key": str, "value":   str}   : match event (match_start etc.)
#
# Requires: pip install redis
